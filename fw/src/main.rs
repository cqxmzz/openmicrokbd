//! OpenMicro macropad firmware — STM32F072CBT6 + embassy.
//!
//! Pin map is the CoHDL design's (src/openmicro_parts.cohdl,
//! the position-aware GPIO assignment) — if the .cohdl changes, this table is
//! the one to update:
//!
//!   ROW0..3  = PA9  PA10 PB3  PB8   (outputs, drive high per scan step)
//!   COL0..3  = PB4  PB5  PC14 PC13  (inputs, pull-down; diode cathode -> COL)
//!   ENC_A/B  = PB12 PB13 (quadrature, pull-up, common to GND)
//!   ENC_SW   = PB15      (pull-up, active low)
//!   JOY_X/Y  = PB1/ADC_IN9  PA0/ADC_IN0 (stick mounted rotated: the JOY_X
//!              net senses vertical travel — adc_task swaps the channels)
//!   JOY_SW   = PA15      (pull-up, active low; DEAD on the 2026-08 fab —
//!              that revision's footprint paired the switch poles by column
//!              instead of by row, shorting the line to GND through the
//!              switch body; fixed in openmicro_parts.cohdl for the next spin)
//!   TOUCH    = PB9       (RC charge-time sensing, no external R)
//!   LED_KEY  = PA8       (13x SK6812MINI-E per-key chain)
//!   LED_UG   = PB14      (8x SK6812MINI-E perimeter underglow ring)
//!
//! COL2/COL3 sit on PC14/PC13, which are behind the VBAT power switch and can
//! only source a few mA. That is fine here and deliberate: in COL2ROW the
//! columns are only ever READ. Do not move an output onto them.
//!   USB      = PA11/PA12 (FS device; HSI48 + CRS, crystal not required)
//!
//! The `proto` Cargo feature selects the PROTOTYPE pin map instead — boards
//! fabbed before the 2026-07-28 GPIO re-derivation: rows PA9 PB3 PB6 PB5,
//! cols PB8 PB7 PA15 PA10, encoder PC13/PC14/PC15, joystick push PA8,
//! JOY_Y PB0/ADC_IN8, per-key chain PB4, 16-LED underglow ring on PA0.
//! Touch, USB, and SWD are identical on both revisions.
//!
//! HID map: every input's emitted code is CONFIGURABLE and stored in flash
//! (keymap.rs) — all 13 keys are independent positions (including the pair
//! under the 2U keycap). Factory defaults: keys F13..F20 + Shift+F13..F17
//! (interceptable on every OS), encoder -> volume/mute, touch -> play/pause,
//! joystick -> arrows/enter. The joystick alternatively runs in MOUSE mode
//! (keymap.rs joy_mode): a dedicated HID mouse interface carries
//! proportional pointer motion and the stick's push switch becomes left
//! click. GRADE mode rides the same interface with the speed applied
//! squared (sub-pixel creep at 1, brisk at 10) and the left button
//! auto-held while deflected — hover a DaVinci Resolve colour wheel and the
//! stick drags it like a panel trackball.
//!
//! A vendor-defined HID interface (usage page 0xFF60) carries the app
//! protocol: version query, reboot into the bootloader (or the ROM DFU),
//! bootloader/layout info, keymap read/write/save, analog tuning, joystick
//! mode, and unsolicited input-event reports (first byte 0x80) that give the
//! app live press feedback without any OS input-monitoring permission.
//!
//! Boot: since 0.10.0 this image lives at 0x08006000 behind a resident
//! bootloader (../../boot) that validates it (header + CRC, boot.rs) and
//! stays in a driverless HID update mode when it is missing, invalid, asked
//! for (opcode 0x12) or the encoder switch is held at power-up — so an
//! interrupted update can no longer brick the pad. The Cortex-M0 has no
//! VTOR, so our vector table is copied to 0x20000000 and SRAM is remapped
//! to address 0; memory.x keeps the first 0xC0 bytes of RAM and the four
//! handoff words at the top (0x20003FF0) out of the linker's hands. The
//! flash map lives in memory.x and ../../layout/src/lib.rs.
//!
//! Device mode (keymap.rs `device_mode`, persisted with the keymap): the pad
//! normally boots as OpenMicro (1209:0001, the composite above). In the
//! opt-in **Codex Micro compat mode** (codex.rs) it boots with the Codex
//! Micro's USB identity plus a fifth HID interface speaking ChatGPT
//! Desktop's device protocol, and every input is routed there instead of
//! through the keymap (the vendor interface stays, so the app still works).
//! Switch by holding a key while plugging in — the first key of the second
//! row (slot 2, "KEY 03" in the app) → OpenMicro, the second key of that row
//! (slot 3, "KEY 04") → Codex — or with `SET_MODE` from the app. The choice is saved and applies to every later
//! boot; the underglow shows the mode's colour for a moment at power-up.
